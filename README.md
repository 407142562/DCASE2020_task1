# DCASE2020_task1 (Under building)


Under building. (Plan to release in July 2020)

This is an implementation of DCASE 2020 **Task 1a** and **Task 1b** on **Acoustic Scene Classification with Multiple Devices**. We attain 2nds for both Task-1a and Task-1b in the official challenge 2020. [Technical Report](http://dcase.community/documents/challenge2020/technical_reports/DCASE2020_Hu_114.pdf).

We thank sincerely all the team members and advisors from [Georgia Tech ECE](https://chl.ece.gatech.edu/), [Tencent Media Lab](https://avlab.qq.com/#/index), [USTC](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jundu/), and [Univeristy of Enna](https://www.unikore.it/index.php/it/ingegneria-informatica-persone/docenti-del-corso/itemlist/category/1589-siniscalchi).
