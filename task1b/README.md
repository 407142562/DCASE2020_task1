# DCASE2020 task 1b -- Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification

## Introduction
In Task 1b, the main goal is to keep the system size within **500 Kilobytes (KB)**. A post-training quantization method, which is provided by [Tensorflow2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials), is used to compress our neural models. Quantization not only reduces the model size but also improves hardware accelerator latency with little degradation in final classification accuracy.   

In our submission, we used **Dynamic Range Quantization (DRQ)**. In DRQ, neural weights are quantized from floating-point to integer having a 8-bit precision. Leveraging DRQ, we thus transferred our neural architectures from a 32-bit TensorFlow format to a 8-bit TensorFlow-lite format, which compresses the model size to about 1/8 of its original size. According to our experimental evidence, such a compression method resulted in a minor ASC classification drop.


## Experimental results 
Tested on [DCASE 2020 task 1b development data set](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification#subtask-b). The train-test split way follows the official recomendation.  

| System       |   Dev Acc. (size)<br> Original model| Dev Acc. (size) <br> Quantization | 
| :---         |      :----:   | :---: | 
| Official Baseline     | 87.3% (450K)   |  - | 
|   Mobnet  | 95.2% (3.2M)    | 94.8% (411K) | 
|   small-FCNN    |  96.4% (2.8M)    | 96.3% (357K) | 
|   Mobnet + small-FCNN-v1   | 96.8% (1.8M+1.9M)      | 96.7% (497K) | 
|   small-FCNN-v1 + small-FCNN-v2   | 96.5% (1.9M+2.1M)     | 96.3% (499K)|
